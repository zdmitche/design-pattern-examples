# design-pattern-examples

Some examples of common GOF design patterns. These were created with the help of *Head First Design Patterns* and the original GOF book: *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*.

Each project in the solution is a different design pattern. Set one as the startup project and run in order to see that example's output.
